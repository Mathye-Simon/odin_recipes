    <h2>South African style sandwitch</h2>
    <p>It's is very simple to make, yet so majestic! It comes with a lot of variations. We'll be making the most commonly made in South Africa. </p>
    <p>In this recipe oil will be used for most of the ingredients because they have to be fried. Some sauces of your choice or the ones I reccomend and a bit of vegetables to <em>perfect</em> the equation.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Quarter loaf of bread</li>
        <li>Slice of polony</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaf</li>
        <li>Sliced cuccumber</li>
        <li>Sliced potatoes</li>
        <li>Seasoning salt</li>
        <li>Complimentary sauces</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or a large saucepan to a temperature of about 135 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the sliced potatos inside the pan/deep-fryer for about 5 minutes, during that time period flip and stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add your fryed potatoe chips into a large container. Add salt to the container and mix the chips and salt</li>
        <li>Take the quarter loaf and hallow it in the middle removing the top, leaving the sides and bottom of the loaf. Dont throw away anything.</li>
        <li>Start prepping you vegetables. Put the sliced cuccumber and lettuce leaf in a bowl. Add salt, vegetable oil and salt then start tossing them around</li>
        <li>In the same oil you used to fry the potatoes, fry the slice of polony for 1 minute until it turns brown.</li>
        <li>Now its time to put everything together! Start by puting the seasoned lettuce leaf inside the hallowed out bread at the bottom, to trap in the oil and other watery things.</li>
        <li>Inside the bread on top of the lettuce insert about 3 slices of seasoned cuccumbers</li>
        <li>Insert the fried polony on top of the cuccumbers.Then put as many fried potatoes as you can.</li>
        <li>Dress the kota with sauces you like. I recommend musturd sauce</li>
        <li>Put in the top of the quarter loaf as a crown to finish the Kota King!</li>
    </ol>
