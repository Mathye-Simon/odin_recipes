    <h2>Meat and tomato stew</h2>
    <p>Tomato bredie is a popular South African meal and good winter fare. Bredie is an old Cape name for a dish of meat and vegetables stewed together so that the flavors intermingle. The gravy is rich, thick, 
       and full-bodied and obtained by using meat with a fair amount of bone and fat, rolling it in flour, and browning it before the vegetables are added. The flavor improves if left a day or two before eating. Nice with brown rice.
